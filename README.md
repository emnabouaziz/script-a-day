# Daily Challenges – DevOps, Automation & Cloud

This repository contains a series of **daily scripting challenges** focused on DevOps, Automation, and Cloud tasks.  
Each challenge is designed to be solved in ~30 minutes and builds skills in:

- Bash scripting & Linux automation
- System monitoring & log analysis
- Cloud operations (AWS / GCP / Azure)
- Docker & container management
- Infrastructure automation (Terraform / Ansible / CI-CD)

## 🎯 How it works
- Each day = a new folder (`01-bash-log-audit`, `02-python-...`, …)  
- Every folder contains:
  - `SCENARIO.md` → Description of the problem  
  - `solution.sh` / `solution.py` → Your script solution  

## 📂 Current Structure

## ⚡ Goal
Build a portfolio of **hands-on, production-like DevOps automation tasks**, alternating Bash and Python, and gradually increasing complexity.
